# Node.js GraphQL Blog API

This is a Node.js-based backend for a blog application that uses GraphQL as the query language. It provides an efficient and flexible way for clients to query and mutate blog data.



## GraphQL Overview

GraphQL is a powerful and flexible query language that enables efficient and precise data retrieval from APIs. Unlike traditional REST APIs, GraphQL allows clients to request only the data they need, reducing over-fetching or under-fetching of data. GraphQL also provides a single endpoint for all data queries and mutations, making it highly efficient and avoiding the problem of over-fetching multiple endpoints in REST.

### Why GraphQL?

I chose to use GraphQL for this blog application due to its several benefits:

- **Efficiency**: GraphQL allows clients to request only the data they need, reducing the amount of unnecessary data transferred over the network and improving performance.
- **Flexibility**: With GraphQL, clients have the flexibility to request multiple resources in a single query, avoiding the need for multiple round-trip requests as in REST.
- **Scalability**: GraphQL provides a strongly typed schema that enables developers to evolve APIs over time without breaking existing clients, making it highly scalable.
- **Developer Experience**: GraphQL's self-documenting nature and tooling ecosystem make it easy for developers to understand and work with APIs, improving the development experience.


## Features

- GraphQL-powered API for querying and manipulating blog data
- Built with Node.js and Express for a scalable backend
- Supports CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for blog posts
- Authentication and authorization features for secure data access
- Follows best practices for code quality and maintainability
- Fully tested for reliability and stability

## Technologies Used

- Node.js
- Express
- GraphQL
- MongoDB 
- Authentication and authorization libraries (JWT)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Set up your MongoDB or other database connection in `config/database.js`.
4. Set up any necessary environment variables in `config/keys.js` (e.g., JWT secret, database connection URL).
5. Start the server using `npm run start` or `node server.js`.
6. The GraphQL API will be running at `http://localhost:3000/graphql` by default.

## Usage

- Use a GraphQL client (e.g., GraphQL Playground, Apollo Client, etc.) to send queries and mutations to the API.
- Refer to the GraphQL schema and documentation in the codebase for available query and mutation operations.
