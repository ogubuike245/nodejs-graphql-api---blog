# Node.js GraphQL Blog API

This is a Node.js-based backend for a blog application that uses GraphQL as the query language. It provides an efficient and flexible way for clients to query and mutate blog data.

## Features

- GraphQL-powered API for querying and manipulating blog data
- Built with Node.js and Express for a scalable backend
- Supports CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for blog posts
- Authentication and authorization features for secure data access
- Follows best practices for code quality and maintainability
- Fully tested for reliability and stability

## Technologies Used

- Node.js
- Express
- GraphQL
- MongoDB 
- Authentication and authorization libraries (JWT)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Set up your MongoDB or other database connection in `config/database.js`.
4. Set up any necessary environment variables in `config/keys.js` (e.g., JWT secret, database connection URL).
5. Start the server using `npm run start` or `node server.js`.
6. The GraphQL API will be running at `http://localhost:3000/graphql` by default.

## Usage

- Use a GraphQL client (e.g., GraphQL Playground, Apollo Client, etc.) to send queries and mutations to the API.
- Refer to the GraphQL schema and documentation in the codebase for available query and mutation operations.
